# First Thought of Doing This

201907, we’ve registered a company in Beijing and working almost full time on the project we were thinking for a while. There’s only two of us right now, and I don’t want/like to emerge ourselves in the exciting mood of being a Founder or a CEO. That’s something you have to admit in many scenarios but you don’t have to call it all the time. The thing is, there’s hell a lot of shits to do.

I’m pretty new to git (in order to work with my pal), and I do understand GitHub is not a place for blog. And I start this repo inspired by [Xiaolai Li][1]’s recent project here [Regular Investing in Box][2]. Open source a book and track every single step of building it would be an interesting yet useful tool for me as well. There’s a lot I would like to share and if I may, it would be great other entrepreneurs in China can have a place to contribute to some of the topics will be addressed here in future, continuously. 

Let’s see how it works. Cheers.
